Thread-Level Speculation with Kernel Support
============================================

This repository contains the source code of the K-TLS and U-TLS systems as
described in [this paper][paper-st] (also available on [ACM][paper-acm]; download [paper as PDF][paper-github] or [slides][slides-github]):
> C. Hammacher, K. Streit, A. Zeller and S. Hack. Thread-Level Speculation with
> Kernel Support. In *Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on
> Compiler Construction (CC '16)*, pages 1-11, March 2016.

Additionally, the sources of the improved [tinySTM] implementation (with
improved data structures for better scalability) is included.

Building
========

The software (TinySTM, U-TLS and K-TLS) is split into different directories in
the `lib` folder.
All this software can be built by running the `make` command. If you need to
pass additional compiler or preprocessor flags, you place them in the
corresponding environment variables, for example like this:
```
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include make
```

The kernel module is compiled for the currently running kernel.
If the directory `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build` does not exist, the Makefile
will output a warning and skip compilation of the kernel module.

Usage
=====

Before running experiments using K-TLS, make sure to load the kernel module:
```
  sudo insmod lib/KTLS/kmod/KTLS.ko
```

For debugging, load the module with the debug level set to `3` or `4`, and
observe the kernel messages printed:
```
  sudo insmod lib/KTLS/kmod/KTLS.ko debug=3
  dmesg -wT
```

The API (for both C and C++) for creating a task list is documented in the
[tls.h header file](include/TLS/tls.h).
This task list can then be run either in K-TLS or in U-TLS by running the
`ktls_run` (see [ktls.h header file](include/TLS/ktls.h)) or `utls_run` (see
[utls.h header file](include/TLS/utls.h)) function respectively.

For K-TLS, there is also a loop interface, which makes instrumentation easier
for speculative loop parallelization. Currently, the implementation just
internally aggregates a task for each iteration, and spawns them once 16 tasks
are available.

A few *example usages* of the interface are available in the [test directory](test/).
