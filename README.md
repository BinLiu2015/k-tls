Thread-Level Speculation with Kernel Support
============================================

This repository contains the source code of the K-TLS and U-TLS systems as
described in [this paper][paper-st] (also available on [ACM][paper-acm]; download [paper as PDF][paper-github] or [slides][slides-github]):
> C. Hammacher, K. Streit, A. Zeller and S. Hack. Thread-Level Speculation with
> Kernel Support. In *Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on
> Compiler Construction (CC '16)*, pages 1-11, March 2016.

Additionally, the sources of the improved [tinySTM] implementation (with
improved data structures for better scalability) is included.

All this software can be built by running the `make` command. If you need to
pass additional compiler or preprocessor flags, you can pass them on the
command line as follows:
```
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include make
```
